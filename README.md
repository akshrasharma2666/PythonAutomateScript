# PythonAutomateScript
Here, I have integrate the AWS services, configuring Hadoop-Cluster, Launch a container on Docker and configuring  a webserver on the top of Redhat-8 OS and many more using Python-code. I have created an automation menu script so that by one clickÂ , you will be able to launch any of the above service instead of manual operations.
